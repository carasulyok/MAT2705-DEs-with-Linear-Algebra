            <title>Goals</title>
            <p>
              This course seeks to familiarize students with the general ideas of ordinary differential equations and linear systems of such equations, while introducing elementary notions of linear algebra which facilitate the understanding of linear differential equations, either alone or in systems. Emphasis is on first- and second-order differential equations, those which most frequently occur in applications.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Objectives</title>
            <p>
               First-order differenital equations provide a view of the geometric setting of differential equations through the directionfield, and a taste of solution techniques through the two most commonly occurs first-order differential equation types: separabel and linear. Students hsould be able to interpret a directionfield plot, and know whether a first-order differential equation is separable or linear (in either variable) or neither, and should be able to apply their respective solution algorithms when they are appropriate and the algebraic/calculus operations involved are reasonable, and understand the difference between explicit and implicit solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students should be able to solve homogeneous second-order constant coefficient differential equations and understand the different kinds of solutions which are possible, including complex characteristic values. (If the current text handles differential equations of any order in this context, emphasis should be on the less exotic possibilities, as in the method of undetermined coefficients, for example.) They should be able to use the method of undeterminedd coefficients for reasonable driving functions in the nonhomogeneous case and understand the difference between the undetermined coefficients of the technique and the arbitrary constants which appear in the solution. Since the harmonically driven damped harmonic oscillator system is the single most important application of this and connects somewhat to their intuition and prior knowledge from high school physics, it is reasonable that it be used as an example for them. The opportunity to discuss resonance also sets the stage for real applications of eigenvalue analysis (modal analysis) in the linear system case, while the interpretation of the steady state and transient parts of the solution give a physical setting to the mathematical distinction between the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to appreciate systems of differential equations as well as the nature of higher order linear differential equations, students must acquire some familiarity with matrix algebra and matrix techniques for solving linear systems of equations, including row reduced echelon form with backsubstitution, the determinant (without exaggerating computational techniques), and inverse matrices. Then students should digest the idea of vector spaces, subpaces, span, linear independence and dependence, bases and dimension, with the emphasis on <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> spaces only (and perhaps in passing back to differential equation, metniod of the polynomial spaces) and while discussing higher-order differential equations, solutions spaces of linear homogeneous differential equations as examples, in order to understand the linear aspects of the eigenvalue technique for solving linear (homogeneous) systems of ordinary dfferential equations (with diagonalizable coefficient matrices). It seems reasonable and expected that they should be able to handle complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors in this process. Optionally, some exposure to simply nonhomogeneous systems can give them insight into more complicated applications of this process.
            </p>
            <p>
              A valuable capstone topic is the treatment of a coupled system of harmonic oscillators, where reduction of order shows them how one handles higher-order linear systems, the second order case being extremely important for dynamics. Whether or not this is requried material for testing, it gives an arena where their intuition about vibrating objects helps them see this eigenvalue technique as a more concrete activity, building on the simple harmonic oscillator problem.

            <title>Matrix Linear Algebra Note</title>
            <p>
              In addition to supporting the linear foundations of the differential equations studied in this course, the matrix mathematics covered here also provides many students in their own exposure to a careful treatment of solving linear systems of equations using row reduction methods. They should thoroughly understand the reduction process, and the backsubstition steps from the reduced matrix to the parameterized solution of a linear system of equations <m>A\vec{x}=\vec{b}</m>, utilizing technology for the row echelon reduction process once understoof. Going further, they should also understand the interpretation of a nonhomogeneous linear syttem <m>A\vec{x}=\vec{b}</m> as resolving the problem of finding the most general coefficients of a linear combination of the columns of the coefficient matrix <m>A</m> which eqals the vector <m>b</m>:
              <me>
                x^1Col(A,1)+\cdots+x^nCol(A,n)=b
              </me>.
              Correspondingly, they should understand the interpretation of the solution of a homogeneous linear system <m>A\vec{x}=\vec{0}</m> as finding the most general coefficients of a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m> which is the zero vector, i.e., a linear relationship among those vectors when nonzero. Each free variable (replaced by a parameter in writing down the solution) in the general solution multiples a vector of coefficients representing an independent such linear relationship among those vectors.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Maple Use</title>
            <p>
              All students should learn quickly how to input any combination of differential equations and initial conditions in standard prime derivative notation and how to solve them using the context-sensitive menu choice <q>Solve DE</q>. The course shoudl test the solution algorithms and how to interpret what the solutions mean and what structure they have. Knowing the solution is a good check.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, any matrix is easy to input from the Matrix palette and the context-sensitive menu enables the student to find its row reduced form, calculate its determinant and inverse if appropriate (simply a <q><m>-1</m></q> superscript on the matrix!), and eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The LinearSolveTutor with the Gauss-Jordan reduction choice from teh Student[LinearAlgebra] package (available directly from the Tutors menu) should be highlighted in learning the matrix reduction process and in solving linear systems. Matrix multiplication to confirm diagonalization of a square matrix using the matrix of eigenvalues and its inverse is trivial in standard math notation in the Maple input region.

      <title>zyBook Participation Activities</title>
      <p>
        Reading assignments including questions graded for completion to give you the opportunity to check your understanding will be regularly assigned in our zyBook. These assignments are meant to be done <em>before</em> we cover content in lecture so that we have more time for active learning in class. <alert>You will receive full credit for a zyBook Participation Activity if you answer the questions.</alert> Because these zyBook Participation Activities are your first exposure to the material, we do not expect you to understand everything from the reading alone. <em>You will gain the most from these activities if you take them seriously, think about the questions before answering, and work to understand the reasoning for the correct answer when you get a question incorrect.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        zyBook Participation Activities are due each Tuesday morning at 8am CT. They are worth 3% of your course grade. No late zyBook Participation Activities will be accepted, but the lowest three scores will be dropped.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Discussion Participation</title>
      <p>
        Starting in the second week, the teaching assistants will take attendance in discussion. Mathematics is a human activity, and we learn by engaging with other humans. Discussion allows you to do this in a small enough group that every student can interact with peers and their TA during each meeting. Students who do not actively participate during activities in discussion may not receive credit for participation. You must attend the discussion section for which you are registered; missed discussion sections may not be made up. However, we will drop three, so discussion participation will be taken out of 10 and is 3% of your course grade.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>zyBook Challenge Activities</title>
      <p>
        Most weeks you will have a zyBook Challenge Activity. Unlike the zyBook Participation Activities, the zyBook Challenge Activities are (automatically) graded for correctness. The zyBook Challenge Activities follow up on material from lecture after you have also had time to work on the material in discussion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        zyBook Challenge Activities are due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. They are worth 7% of your course grade. No late zyBook Challenge Activities will be accepted, but the lowest two scores will be dropped.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Written Homework</title>
      <p>
        Most weeks you will have a written homework assignment. These will give you an opportunity to write out proofs and solutions in the manner that you will be expected to on the exams. You will submit your solutions using Gradescope following instructions provided on Canvas. The questions on each written homework will be graded for correctness by the TAs and graders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaborating with other students on the written homework is encouraged, but you must write up all reasoning and solutions on your own (in other words, no copying). Failure to abide by this guideline could be construed as a form of academic dishonesty. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this course is to develop your ability to understand and construct mathematical arguments or proofs. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and applications (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Copilot, DALL-E, and others) for written homework does not support the learning objectives of this course and is prohibited. Using them in any way for written homework in this course is a violation of the course’s expectations and will be addressed through UW–Madison’s academic misconduct policy, specifically UWS 14.03(1)b (b) Uses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each problem on written homework should be completed with neat, understandable, detailed solutions and explanations. Your explanations and proofs must be sound and rigorous, paying attention to detail and clarity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Written homework is due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. It is worth 15% of your course grade. Late written homework will generally not be accepted. Since you likely will either experience a technical difficulty (e.g., missed the deadline, your computer shut down as you were submitting it, internet outage, etc.) or a personal emergency (being sick, attending a funeral, etc.) during the semester, the two lowest two written homework scores will be dropped. You do not need to contact your instructor or TA if such a situation does come up. 
      </p>

      <title>Tests and Exams</title>
      <p>
        This course will have two tests and a final exam. Each will be worth 24% of your course grade. The dates and times for these assessments are:
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Test I</title>
            <p>

        </dl>
      </p>
      <p>
        Students must use the form provided on Canvas to inform the instructor of conflicts with the dates and times of the tests or final exam during the first two week of classes. Reports of conflicts will be reviewed. Submitting incorrect information in order to take a test or the final exam at a different time may be considered an act of academic misconduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        During exams, students will not be allowed to use any notes or electronic devices. Ample space will be provided on the exams for you to show your work. You must bring a writing utensil.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Added March 7, 2025</em>: If a student's overall course grade would increase by using their final exam score in place of the lower of their scores on Test I and Test II, they will receive the grade based on this alternative grade computation method.

      <title>Incomplete Grades</title>
      <p>
        Incomplete grades will be assigned only under extraordinary circumstances in accordance with L&#x26;S policy, which states as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <q>An Incomplete (I) may be reported for a student who has been enrolled in a course with a passing grade until near the end of the semester/term and then, due to illness or some other unusual and substantiated cause beyond the student’s control, has been unable to take or complete the final examination (or to complete some limited amount of term work). An Incomplete is not given to a student who stays away from a final examination unless the student proves to the instructor that he or she was prevented from attending as indicated above. In the absence of such proof the grade reported will be an F. Even when a student can provide verifiable documentation, a student may still earn a grade of F if his/her work convinces the instructor that the student cannot successfully pass the course.</q>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If you feel an incomplete grade may be warranted, you must contact me <em>before</em> the end of the final examination period on Friday, May 9, 2025.
