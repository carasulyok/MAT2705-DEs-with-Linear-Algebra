            <title>Course Description</title>
            <p>
              <!-- This course seeks to familiarize students with the general ideas of ordinary differential equations and linear systems of such equations, while introducing elementary notions of linear algebra which facilitate the understanding of linear differential equations, either alone or in systems. Emphasis is on first- and second-order differential equations, those which most frequently occur in applications. -->
              The construction of mathematical models to address real-world problems has been one of the most important aspects of each of the branches of science. It is often the case that these mathematical models are formulated in terms of equations involving functions as well as their derivatives. Such equations are called <em>differential equations</em>. This course will demonstrate the usefulness of ordinary differential equations for modeling physical and other phenomena. Complementary mathematical approaches for their solutions will be presented, including analytical methods, graphical analysis, and numerical techniques. The basic content of this course includes: first-order equations, mathematical models, matrix algebra, linear equations of second- and higher-order, nonlinear systems and phase plane analysis, and numerical methods.

            <title>Course Objectives</title>
            <!-- <p>
               First-order differential equations provide a view of the geometric setting of differential equations through the directionfield, and a taste of solution techniques through the two most commonly occurs first-order differential equation types: separabel and linear. Students hsould be able to interpret a directionfield plot, and know whether a first-order differential equation is separable or linear (in either variable) or neither, and should be able to apply their respective solution algorithms when they are appropriate and the algebraic/calculus operations involved are reasonable, and understand the difference between explicit and implicit solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students should be able to solve homogeneous second-order constant coefficient differential equations and understand the different kinds of solutions which are possible, including complex characteristic values. (If the current text handles differential equations of any order in this context, emphasis should be on the less exotic possibilities, as in the method of undetermined coefficients, for example.) They should be able to use the method of undeterminedd coefficients for reasonable driving functions in the nonhomogeneous case and understand the difference between the undetermined coefficients of the technique and the arbitrary constants which appear in the solution. Since the harmonically driven damped harmonic oscillator system is the single most important application of this and connects somewhat to their intuition and prior knowledge from high school physics, it is reasonable that it be used as an example for them. The opportunity to discuss resonance also sets the stage for real applications of eigenvalue analysis (modal analysis) in the linear system case, while the interpretation of the steady state and transient parts of the solution give a physical setting to the mathematical distinction between the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to appreciate systems of differential equations as well as the nature of higher order linear differential equations, students must acquire some familiarity with matrix algebra and matrix techniques for solving linear systems of equations, including row reduced echelon form with backsubstitution, the determinant (without exaggerating computational techniques), and inverse matrices. Then students should digest the idea of vector spaces, subpaces, span, linear independence and dependence, bases and dimension, with the emphasis on <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> spaces only (and perhaps in passing back to differential equation, metniod of the polynomial spaces) and while discussing higher-order differential equations, solutions spaces of linear homogeneous differential equations as examples, in order to understand the linear aspects of the eigenvalue technique for solving linear (homogeneous) systems of ordinary dfferential equations (with diagonalizable coefficient matrices). It seems reasonable and expected that they should be able to handle complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors in this process. Optionally, some exposure to simply nonhomogeneous systems can give them insight into more complicated applications of this process.
            </p>
            <p>
              A valuable capstone topic is the treatment of a coupled system of harmonic oscillators, where reduction of order shows them how one handles higher-order linear systems, the second order case being extremely important for dynamics. Whether or not this is requried material for testing, it gives an arena where their intuition about vibrating objects helps them see this eigenvalue technique as a more concrete activity, building on the simple harmonic oscillator problem.

            <title>Matrix Linear Algebra Note</title>
            <p>
              In addition to supporting the linear foundations of the differential equations studied in this course, the matrix mathematics covered here also provides many students in their own exposure to a careful treatment of solving linear systems of equations using row reduction methods. They should thoroughly understand the reduction process, and the backsubstition steps from the reduced matrix to the parameterized solution of a linear system of equations <m>A\vec{x}=\vec{b}</m>, utilizing technology for the row echelon reduction process once understoof. Going further, they should also understand the interpretation of a nonhomogeneous linear syttem <m>A\vec{x}=\vec{b}</m> as resolving the problem of finding the most general coefficients of a linear combination of the columns of the coefficient matrix <m>A</m> which eqals the vector <m>b</m>:
              <me>
                x^1Col(A,1)+\cdots+x^nCol(A,n)=b
              </me>.
              Correspondingly, they should understand the interpretation of the solution of a homogeneous linear system <m>A\vec{x}=\vec{0}</m> as finding the most general coefficients of a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m> which is the zero vector, i.e., a linear relationship among those vectors when nonzero. Each free variable (replaced by a parameter in writing down the solution) in the general solution multiples a vector of coefficients representing an independent such linear relationship among those vectors.
            </p> -->
            <p>
              We will discuss Chapters 1<ndash/>7 of the textbook, including some extra topics. After successful completion of the class, you should be able to do the following:

            <title>Maple Use</title>
            <p>
              All students should learn quickly how to input any combination of differential equations and initial conditions in standard prime derivative notation and how to solve them using the context-sensitive menu choice <q>Solve DE</q>. The course shoudl test the solution algorithms and how to interpret what the solutions mean and what structure they have. Knowing the solution is a good check.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, any matrix is easy to input from the Matrix palette and the context-sensitive menu enables the student to find its row reduced form, calculate its determinant and inverse if appropriate (simply a <q><m>-1</m></q> superscript on the matrix!), and eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The LinearSolveTutor with the Gauss-Jordan reduction choice from teh Student[LinearAlgebra] package (available directly from the Tutors menu) should be highlighted in learning the matrix reduction process and in solving linear systems. Matrix multiplication to confirm diagonalization of a square matrix using the matrix of eigenvalues and its inverse is trivial in standard math notation in the Maple input region.

            <title>Software</title>
            <p>
              From the Mathematical Association of America, <q>Advances in technology, together with an increased interest in dynamical systems, are influencing the nature of many first courses in ordinary differential equations. In addition, there is an increased emphasis on nonlinear differential equations, and mathematical modeling, as well as on qualitative and numerical approaches that shed light on the behavior of solutions. Analytic techniques are still important, but they no longer tend to be the sole focus.</q> As such, this course will include a software component for solving systems that are either tedious to solve, or cannot be solved, by hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will primarily utilize MATLAB in this course (freely available to Villanova University students at <url href="https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/villanova-university-30843248.html" />). No previous knowledge of MATLAB will be assumed for this course. Other software packages may be utilized at the instructor's discretion.

        <p>
          Students are expected to assist in maintaining a classroom environment conducive to learning. Disruptive behavior in the classroom may be classified as anything that disturbs the instructor or other students during the class period. Please be considerate of your instructor and classmates by refraining from cell phone use during class. It is incredibly distracting not only to yourself, but also to classmates and the instructor. Please do not have phones out unless it is for a class activity, such as an online quiz or poll.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will provide note-taking guides to fill out during class, and I <em>highly</em> recommend that you take notes with me as I write since it has been shown that we retain and comprehend information much more deeply when we write it as opposed to just seeing it. It will also help you pay attention and keep you engaged. If I give students an opportunity to try a problem on their own during class, I recommend trying it! This is time for you to check your understanding, not for me. You will not know what you do not understand until you try it on your own; solely watching me do it is a completely different level of comprehension. The more you participate and ask questions, the more you will get from the class.

            <title>Homework Assignments</title>
            <p>
              Homework will be assigned weekly on MyLab related to the Learning Targets listed below. It will serve as an opportunity to practice the concepts and techniques learned in class. The initial due dates will be on Thursdays at 11:59 pm. Certain weeks may have more than one skill to work on. You must make your first attempts by the due date, but you will have unlimited attempts until the end of the semester to demonstrate proficiency in each skill. It takes time to work on new skills and having multiple attempts and the full semester affords you the chance to practice and not be penalized for an initial incorrect answer or mistake. These problems are auto-graded by MyLab as either fully correct or not. There is no partial credit.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will also have <q>bigger picture</q> Applications/Concepts assignments due on most Wednesdays. Due dates (which are typically at least one week after seeing the necessary material in class) are posted on the Course Calendar. Each Applications/Concepts assignment is designed to tie together multiple concepts from class or relate class material to an application. There will be one or two multi-part questions on each assignment, but waiting until the last minute to start them is not a good idea. Applications/Concepts assignments are due in class on the day marked on the Course Calendar. If you will be absent from class on the day that an Applications/Concepts assignment is due, please email me a <em>single PDF</em> prior to the start of class. Late assignments will not be accepted unless otherwise discussed with the instructor.

            <title>Worksheets and Labs</title>
            <p>
              The more actively involved you are during class time, the better you will learn the material. (In fact, research has shown that classes that are entirely lecture-based have significantly higher failure rates.) To encourage your learning, the class time will be a mixture of lecture and other activities. Participation will be expected, and it is part of your grade. As one of the active learning techniques used in this class, there will be worksheets, labs, and other participation assignments given throughout the semester. The worksheets are intended to give opportunities for group discussions about the material. Labs will give students the opportunity to practice using software. If you miss class on the day of a worksheet or in-class assignment, it is your responsibility to find a copy of it on Blackboard to complete and turn in. Late assignments will not be accepted unless otherwise discussed with the instructor.

            <title>Projects</title>

              There will be at least one project assigned during the course. The project will involve an application problem of one's interest (using software tools) and providing a written report of the mathematical results obtained that also details what those results mean in terms of the system being studied. More information will be provided once the project is assigned. Late projects will not be accepted unless otherwise discussed with the instructor.

              The style and grading of exams in this course may be different from anything you have experienced. We will use a method commonly referred to as <q>Grading for Growth</q> or <q>Mastery-Based Testing.</q> There will be three in-class Mastery Concept Days throughout the semester. Instead of using a percentage-based or points-based system on these exams, your grade will be determined by how well you display a mastery of specific mathematical objects called Concepts/Learning Targets. The 19 Learning Targets for this course are listed below. Since there are no points, there is no partial credit. Students only receive credit when they display <q>mastery,</q> but there is a reassessment system in place that allows students to try a concept more than once to demonstrate understanding. You will have your first attempt at a concept on the week you submit the corresponding homework on MyLab; Concept Days will be announced with at least one week notice.

              The final exam is scheduled by the University and is noted on our Course Calendar. The final exam time will serve as the last retesting opportunity and will include the remainder of the 19 Learning Targets that have not yet been mastered. If a student has already mastered all of the concepts, they will not need to take the final exam.

        <title>Calculating Exam Averages</title>
        <p>
          Each student's exam average begins at 0 and is increased each time they master a learning target. Thus, you are progressively earning your grade over the course of the semester. The mastery of a single learning target will add 5.263% to the exam average so that a student who has mastered all 19 learning targets receives a 100% test average. If you receive a <q>P</q> on a learning target, you are advised to retest that concept. A grade of <q>P</q> will only add 2.5% to your test average per learning target, so no student will obtain a passing exam score with zero mastered concepts.  No credit is awarded for an <q>X.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary source of extra attempts comes from the fact that once a concept has been tested, it will continue to appear on every subsequent Concept Day. Therefore, Concept Days get longer as the semester goes on and more learning targets are covered. <em>There is not time to complete all 19 learning targets on a single day.</em> Students are encouraged not to attempt all learning targets on every Concept Day, but to use their time wisely to attempt concepts they are most prepared for. There is no penalty for not attempting a learning target since it can be retested later. Also, once you have mastered a learning target, you can skip that problem. Each learning target is graded separately. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Fair Warning:</alert> This may be more complicated than the typical grading style you have become accustomed to over the years. That's okay! If at any point in the semester you need clarification on how the system works or your standing in the course, I encourage you to talk to or email me. The goal with this system is to provide you with <em>more control</em> over your grade with <em>less stress</em> and to reflect <alert>your effort and improvement</alert> (and negate the previously large impact of a single bad test day). It does not matter to me <em>when</em> in the semester you master a certain concept, just that you master it! Do not be discouraged if you do not master a learning target on the first attempt (or even the first few attempts). That's normal! <alert>Failure, though often viewed negatively, is an integral part of the learning process. The way to truly learn a subject is to make mistakes, learn from them, and do better next time.</alert>

Students who expect to miss a class or assignment due to the observance of a religious holiday should discuss the matter with their professors as soon as possible, normally at least two weeks in advance.

        <p>
          All students are expected to uphold Villanova's Academic Integrity Policy and Code. Any incident of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for disciplinary action. You may view the <url href="https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/provost/resources/student/policies/integrity.html">University's Academic Integrity Policy and Code</url> for a detailed description.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a student is found responsible for an academic integrity violation, which results in a grade penalty, they may not WX the course unless they are approved to WX for significant medical reasons.  Students applying for a WX based on significant medical reasons, must submit documentation and their request for an exception will be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I allow <em>and encourage</em> students to work together and discuss assignments. However, there are differences between working together (collaborating) and what may constitute a violation of academic integrity. <em>Working together/collaborating</em> means you and your peer(s) talk about a problem, work together to figure it out, but then write up and submit your answers independently. To be sure to avoid what may look like copying and possibly violating the Academic Integrity Policy, take a short break between working in a group and writing up your answers.

            <p>
              My pronouns are he/him/his.
              I ask that you address me as <q>Prof. Keller</q> or <q>Dr.
              Keller</q>, the appropriate professional forms.
              Since this is not high school, please do not address me as <q>Mr. Keller</q>.
              In general, you will find that I am not an overly formal individual.
              However, academia has a long history of marginalizing scholars<mdash/>professors, librarians, and students<mdash/>who don't present as the Hollywood image of a professor (older, white, male).
              Using titles for all your instructors is a small way that we can make the academy more inclusive.
              Therefore, in solidarity with my colleagues of all identities and backgrounds, <q>Prof.
              Keller</q> is the form of address that I prefer.

      <title>zyBook Participation Activities</title>
      <p>
        Reading assignments including questions graded for completion to give you the opportunity to check your understanding will be regularly assigned in our zyBook. These assignments are meant to be done <em>before</em> we cover content in lecture so that we have more time for active learning in class. <alert>You will receive full credit for a zyBook Participation Activity if you answer the questions.</alert> Because these zyBook Participation Activities are your first exposure to the material, we do not expect you to understand everything from the reading alone. <em>You will gain the most from these activities if you take them seriously, think about the questions before answering, and work to understand the reasoning for the correct answer when you get a question incorrect.</em>
      </p>

        zyBook Participation Activities are due each Tuesday morning at 8am CT. They are worth 3% of your course grade. No late zyBook Participation Activities will be accepted, but the lowest three scores will be dropped.

      <title>Discussion Participation</title>
      <p>
        Starting in the second week, the teaching assistants will take attendance in discussion. Mathematics is a human activity, and we learn by engaging with other humans. Discussion allows you to do this in a small enough group that every student can interact with peers and their TA during each meeting. Students who do not actively participate during activities in discussion may not receive credit for participation. You must attend the discussion section for which you are registered; missed discussion sections may not be made up. However, we will drop three, so discussion participation will be taken out of 10 and is 3% of your course grade.

      <title>zyBook Challenge Activities</title>
      <p>
        Most weeks you will have a zyBook Challenge Activity. Unlike the zyBook Participation Activities, the zyBook Challenge Activities are (automatically) graded for correctness. The zyBook Challenge Activities follow up on material from lecture after you have also had time to work on the material in discussion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        zyBook Challenge Activities are due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. They are worth 7% of your course grade. No late zyBook Challenge Activities will be accepted, but the lowest two scores will be dropped.

      <title>Written Homework</title>
      <p>
        Most weeks you will have a written homework assignment. These will give you an opportunity to write out proofs and solutions in the manner that you will be expected to on the exams. You will submit your solutions using Gradescope following instructions provided on Canvas. The questions on each written homework will be graded for correctness by the TAs and graders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaborating with other students on the written homework is encouraged, but you must write up all reasoning and solutions on your own (in other words, no copying). Failure to abide by this guideline could be construed as a form of academic dishonesty. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this course is to develop your ability to understand and construct mathematical arguments or proofs. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and applications (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Copilot, DALL-E, and others) for written homework does not support the learning objectives of this course and is prohibited. Using them in any way for written homework in this course is a violation of the course’s expectations and will be addressed through UW–Madison’s academic misconduct policy, specifically UWS 14.03(1)b (b) Uses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each problem on written homework should be completed with neat, understandable, detailed solutions and explanations. Your explanations and proofs must be sound and rigorous, paying attention to detail and clarity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Written homework is due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. It is worth 15% of your course grade. Late written homework will generally not be accepted. Since you likely will either experience a technical difficulty (e.g., missed the deadline, your computer shut down as you were submitting it, internet outage, etc.) or a personal emergency (being sick, attending a funeral, etc.) during the semester, the two lowest two written homework scores will be dropped. You do not need to contact your instructor or TA if such a situation does come up.

      <title>Tests and Exams</title>
      <p>
        This course will have two tests and a final exam. Each will be worth 24% of your course grade. The dates and times for these assessments are:
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Test I</title>
            <p>
              Wednesday, February 26, 2025. 7:30<ndash/>9pm. Location announced via Canvas.
            </p>

          <li>
            <title>Test II</title>
            <p>
              Wednesday, April 9, 2025. 7:30<ndash/>9pm. Location announced via Canvas.
            </p>

            <title>Final Exam</title>
            <p>
              Tuesday, May 6, 2025. 5:05<ndash/>7:05pm. Location announced via Canvas.
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <p>
        Students must use the form provided on Canvas to inform the instructor of conflicts with the dates and times of the tests or final exam during the first two week of classes. Reports of conflicts will be reviewed. Submitting incorrect information in order to take a test or the final exam at a different time may be considered an act of academic misconduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        During exams, students will not be allowed to use any notes or electronic devices. Ample space will be provided on the exams for you to show your work. You must bring a writing utensil.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Added March 7, 2025</em>: If a student's overall course grade would increase by using their final exam score in place of the lower of their scores on Test I and Test II, they will receive the grade based on this alternative grade computation method.

      Grades will be calculated to two decimal places. They will <em>not</em> be rounded up to the next integer. The lower cutoff for each letter grade is given in the table below. It is possible that these cutoffs will be adjusted at the end of the semester. However, if this is done, it will only be done in a way that benefits students by lowering the cutoff to earn a given letter grade.

      <title>Incomplete Grades</title>
      <p>
        Incomplete grades will be assigned only under extraordinary circumstances in accordance with L&#x26;S policy, which states as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <q>An Incomplete (I) may be reported for a student who has been enrolled in a course with a passing grade until near the end of the semester/term and then, due to illness or some other unusual and substantiated cause beyond the student’s control, has been unable to take or complete the final examination (or to complete some limited amount of term work). An Incomplete is not given to a student who stays away from a final examination unless the student proves to the instructor that he or she was prevented from attending as indicated above. In the absence of such proof the grade reported will be an F. Even when a student can provide verifiable documentation, a student may still earn a grade of F if his/her work convinces the instructor that the student cannot successfully pass the course.</q>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If you feel an incomplete grade may be warranted, you must contact me <em>before</em> the end of the final examination period on Friday, May 9, 2025.
